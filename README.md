## 1. Working with Mocks ( first module )

| What's new                                              | Concept |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| ✅ Mocks  |  Objects that simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled way    |
| ✅ rejects (assert)  |  If asyncFn is a function and it throws an error synchronously, assert.rejects() will return a rejected Promise with that error. If the function does not return a promise, assert.rejects() will return a rejected Promise with an ERR_INVALID_RETURN_VALUE error. In both cases the error handler is skipped.    |
| ✅ deepStrictEqual (assert)  |  That's compare the return value with the expected value |

## 2. Working with Stubs (first module)
JSON.parse(withoutStub)

| What's new                                              | Concept |
